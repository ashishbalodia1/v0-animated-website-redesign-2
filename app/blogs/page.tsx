- Accelerometers
- Temperature sensors
- EEPROM memory

**I2C Arduino Code:**
Wire library usage:
- Include Wire.h library
- Wire.begin() to start
- Wire.beginTransmission(address)
- Wire.write(data)
- Wire.endTransmission()

**SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):**
- Uses 4 wires: MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS/SS
- Faster than I2C
- Full-duplex communication
- Separate CS for each device
- Speed: Up to 10MHz+

**Common SPI Devices:**
- SD card modules
- RF modules (NRF24L01)
- TFT displays
- Flash memory
- DAC/ADC chips

**When to Use What:**
- I2C: Multiple sensors, short distance
